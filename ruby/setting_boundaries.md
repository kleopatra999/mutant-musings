# Setting Boundaries

If you have done any development at all you know that testing boundary conditions is crucial. what happens to my code when...

- The number is 0
- The number is 1
- The number is at the upper end of the range
- The number is out of range
- The number is negative

If I specify a conditional operator such as `<=` do I have a test for `<`, `==`, AND `>`?

With mutant on your side you should know.
